Along with paper football and a host of other games, Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the most common ways for people bored in class, or just about any setting, to pass the time.
 if you were to ask around, chances are that no one would actually be able to tell you where the much-loved game originated from. Most people learn the game as children on the paper tablecloths of their local diners, and that’s the end of it.

What you may not realize is that both the game and the name of Tic-Tac-Toe have a surprisingly interesting history. Let’s take a closer look and see how it all comes together.

##  <p align=center>Tic-Tac-Toe Origin :
So, with all this said, how did the name progress to Tic-Tac-Toe? Well, as it turns out, that name was originally ascribed to an entirely different game that no longer exists. This game was played by throwing a pencil at a slate covered with numbers, then assigning a score based on counting the numbers hit with the pencil. Think of it like a strange variation of darts. Historians believe the name at the time, Tit-Tat-Toe, came from the sound of the pencil hitting the board. With a slight Americanization to Tic-Tac-Toe, the name would end up living on, even if the actual game wouldn’t.
## <p align=center>Tic-Tac-Toe Today
Today, Tic-Tac-Toe is played worldwide, albeit not always under the same name. When played in England, it’s generally referred to as “noughts and crosses,” the same name it had when it first appeared on the scene in the 1800s. Different regions in Ireland may switch between the names “X’s and O’s,” “Boxin’ Oxen,” and “X-e O-zees.” In Norway, it’s called “Twiddles and Bears.” The good news is that it’s pretty much played the same way in every country, so if you find yourself in an airport, drawing up that famous board is a challenge everyone can recognize.
